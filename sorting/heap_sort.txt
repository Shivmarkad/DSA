As the tree satisfies Max-Heap property, then the largest item is stored at the root node.

Swap: Swap the first element with the last element.

Remove: Remove the last element from the heap.

Heapify: Heapify the root element again so that we have the highest element at root.

Repeat this until all the items of the list are sorted.
