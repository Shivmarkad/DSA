#1-create class method to iterate over the tree

#2- create deleteNode method which takes node add data to be removed 
    -check whether the node is null 
        - if null return that node 
    -check whether data is larger or smaller then node data 
        -if smaller call deleteNode for node's left
        -if larger call deleteNode for node' right
    -both statements false that means we found the node which has data to be deleted
        -check current node is having right and left null or not
        -if both the right and left are null then return null
        -check if left null then return right if right null then return left
    -if both the condition fails then replace node data with right tree's smallest data
    -then repeat step 2 for this node and the data at that node
